# Facial-Emotion-Detection

## Introduction

Facial Emotion Detection is a project that aims to identify human emotions from facial expressions using machine learning techniques. This project leverages computer vision and deep learning to analyze facial features and classify them into distinct emotion categories such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more.

## Features

- Detect and classify facial emotions in real-time.
- Support for multiple emotion categories.
- Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for accurate emotion detection.
- Easy-to-use interface for testing and evaluating the model.

## Dataset

The project uses publicly available datasets such as FER-2013, CK+, or custom datasets for training and evaluating the model. Ensure to download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory before running the project.

## Installation

To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Facial-Emotion-Detection.git
    cd Facial-Emotion-Detection
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the facial emotion detection model:

1. **Training the Model:**

    ```bash
    python train.py --dataset path/to/dataset --epochs 50
    ```

2. **Evaluating the Model:**

    ```bash
    python project.py --model path/to/model
    ```
